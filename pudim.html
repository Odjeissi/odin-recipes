                <li>3 tablespoons heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Caramel Syrup
            <ul>
                <li> cup sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Other
            <ul>
                <li>4-6 cups boiling water (for the water bath)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To 350 degrees F.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat 1 cup of sugar in a shallow pan. Spread it out in an even layer and use a rubber spatula to stir over medium-low heat. The sugar will start to turn brown and clump together. Continue to stir occasionally until it liquefies and turns amber in color. This generally takes about 15 minutes. Make sure to watch it carefully so it doesn’t burn.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place it Into an 8-inch round baking pan as soon as you remove the caramel from the flame. Tilt the pan so that the caramel covers the bottom of the pan in an even layer. Allow the caramel to harden.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine the condensed milk, coconut milk, whole eggs, egg yolks, vanilla extract, heavy cream and salt in a blender. Blend on high speed for 30 seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the baking pan with the hardened caramel in the center of a deep roasting pan. Pour the boiling water into the roasting pan, around the baking pan. The water should come about halfway up the baking pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Once the caramel has cooled and hardened, I spray a paper towel with a little bit of cooking spray and use the paper towel to grease the sides of the pan so the pudim doesn’t stick to the sides while baking.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Into the baking pan, over the hardened caramel. Use a mesh strainer to filter out any bits of egg (there really shouldn’t be any).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake the pudim for 60 minutes. The pudim should be jiggly and resemble the texture and color of an omelette when it’s done. The center should be firm and will have a slight springiness if you touch the center with your finger.</li>
        <br>
        <li>In the water bath for 15 minutes, and then remove the pan and let it sit on the counter for about 1 hour. Once the pudim is room temperature, let the entire pan cool in the refrigerator for about 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Let it sit on the counter for about 15 minutes and run a butter knife around the sides of the pan to loosen the pudim. Place a dish over the pan and invert it. If the pudim doesn’t release right away, try tapping the bottom of the pan. The pudim should release and the caramel syrup will run down over the sides. There will be some hardened sugar left in the pan, this is completely normal and it can be discarded.</li>
